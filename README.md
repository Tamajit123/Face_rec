# Face_Detection_using_Python

In computer vision, one essential problem we are trying to figure out is to automatically detect objects in an image without human intervention. 
Face detection can be thought of as such a problem where we detect human faces in an image. 
There may be slight differences in the faces of humans but overall, it is safe to say that there are certain features that are associated with all the human faces.
There are various face detection algorithms but Viola-Jones Algorithm is one of the oldest methods that is also used today and we will use the same later in the article.

Face Detection: The very first task we perform is detecting faces in the image or video stream. 
Now that we know the exact location/coordinates of face, we extract this face for further processing ahead.

What is OpenCV

In the field of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision is one of the most interesting and Challenging tasks.
Computer Vision acts like a bridge between Computer Software and visualizations around us.
It allows computer software to understand and learn about the visualizations in the surroundings. 
For Example: Based on the color, shape and size determining the fruit. 
This task can be very easy for the human brain however in the Computer Vision pipeline, first we gather the data, then we perform the data processing activities and then we train and teach the model to understand how to distinguish between the fruits based on size, shape and color of fruit.
